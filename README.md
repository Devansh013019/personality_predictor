🧠 Personality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts personality traits based on user input using various machine learning algorithms. It features an interactive web app built with Streamlit, allowing users to easily test the model in real time.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting personality types based on a set of input features. Several classification algorithms were tested, and Logistic Regression provided the best performance.

⚙️ Machine Learning Models Used
	•	✅ Logistic Regression (Best performing)
	•	Support Vector Machine (SVM)
	•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
	•	Naive Bayes
	•	Decision Tree Classifier

⸻

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries
	•	Python
	•	Scikit-learn – ML models and evaluation
	•	Pandas & NumPy – Data preprocessing
	•	Streamlit – Web interface
	•	Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional) – Data visualization

 Include your dataset in the repository (e.g., data.csv) or provide a download link if it’s too large. Ensure the format matches the expected input for the model.
